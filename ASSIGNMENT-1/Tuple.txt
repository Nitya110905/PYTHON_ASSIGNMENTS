What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple. 

-A tuple is an ordered, unchangeable (immutable) collection of items in Python. Once a tuple is created, you cannot add, remove, or change its elements. Tuples are created using parentheses ().


Characteristic	        List	            Tuple
Mutability	            Mutable: Elements can be changed, added, or removed after creation.	Immutable: Cannot be changed after creation. Offers data integrity.
Syntax	Created with square brackets []. my_list = [1, 2, 3]	Created with parentheses (). my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
Performance	Slightly slower and uses more memory due to its dynamic nature.	Slightly faster and more memory-efficient as its size is fixed.
Dictionary Keys	Cannot be used as dictionary keys because they are mutable.	Can be used as dictionary keys because they are immutable and hashable.
Methods	Has many methods to modify the list, like .append(), .pop(), .remove().	Has fewer methods; mostly for counting and searching, like .count() and .index().
