What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple. 

-A tuple is an ordered, unchangeable (immutable) collection of items in Python. Tuples are created using parentheses ().


The primary difference is that lists are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed after they are created, while tuples are immutable, meaning their contents are fixed and cannot be altered. Syntactically, lists are defined using square brackets [], whereas tuples are defined using parentheses ().

Due to their immutable nature, tuples are generally more memory-efficient and slightly faster than lists. A significant practical consequence of this is that tuples can be used as dictionary keys, while mutable lists cannot.
