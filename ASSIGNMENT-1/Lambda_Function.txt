# What is lambda function in python? What we call a function 
# which is incomplete version of a function? 

- A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined with the lambda keyword.

- A function that is an "incomplete" version of another function, with some of its arguments pre-filled, is called a partial function.

- A lambda function is a convenient way to create a simple, single-use function without formally defining it using def.

=> Key Characteristics:

- Anonymous: It has no name.

- Single Expression: It can only contain one expression, which is evaluated and returned. It cannot contain multiple statements or commands.

- Concise Syntax: The syntax is lambda arguments: expression.
